        <div class="subheading mb-5">Education StudentðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Just an education student here at UCR, I am a first year student and am planning to become a teacher. Please hire me, I enjoy what I am doing and look forward to pursuing my dreams of being a part of the education department. I think teachers are very important so that is why I have decided that I want to also make an impact. Teaching is so great and I hope to become a middle school teacher because they are so important and it is not an easy job so I am hoping it wonâ€™t be hard to get a job. I think I should be okay teaching that grade level but I am not too sure cause I have heard nightmare stories about them but I feel it should be fine. I mean I will find out when I get there I guess. <br><br>

        I chose this major because I did not know what else to do and being a teacher has always been something that I enjoyed the idea of. I had great teachers and not so great teachers so I want to give back and make a change and be a good teacher hopefully to my future students. So please hire me because of that. I think this paragraph needs more so let me say that teachers should get more recognition for all the things they do and hard work and I hope that when I go into the workforce that it wonâ€™t be torture but Iâ€™ve heard lots of stories and I am not too sure how I feel about them to be completely honest but anyways. I hope the job market isnâ€™t too bad for me, I think teachers are quite important and everywhere a teacher is needed, there are also a lot of different jobs in education so that is good for me. Hope the stem kids do good cause the job market is not looking so great but at least once they do get a job they are going to make son huge bag, good for them cause their studies and what they learn is terrible and hard and I could never imagine that is why I am education and bachelors of arts. <br><br>

        Some things about me that I feel you should know is that I really hope I donâ€™t actually have to upload this website because I have no idea what I am doing and I hope other people do not see which I am pretty sure they wonâ€™t cause there are so many other students also doing this. Another thing you should know about me is that my favorite color is purple and I really like that color. I have a lot of purple things, except for clothing because it clashes with my skin tone and it does not make me look pretty. So more things about me without getting too personal cause it is the internet, even though my full name is on the website which is very interesting and now I am kinda worried but it's whatever, I want that A so let me continue to type nonsense so I can meet the word count requirements.
